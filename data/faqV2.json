      "answer": "You can qualify for real usable vendor credit immediately. You'll then start to qualify for store credit within 60 days that doesn't require a personal credit check or personal guarantee. Within 6 months you should have access to $50,000+++ in real usable credit, including Visa and MasterCard cash accounts. You can then continue to build $100,000-$250,000 or higher in business credit within a year to two. And with The Business Credit Finance Suite you (and your clients*) can also gain access to other cash funding programs within a couple of months or less."

      "question": "Does business credit really exist?",
      "answer": "Just as you have a credit file linked to your SSN, your business has a profile linked to its EIN. Experian, Equifax, and Dun & Bradstreet often start your profile when your business applies for a loan, credit card, or even when you setup basic utilities. From that point most credit you apply for won't report to the business reporting agencies unless you apply for different types of credit in a particular order, or leave your SSN off of the application. Real business credit can be obtained with no SSN being supplied upon application. This credit doesn't appear on your personal credit reports either. As you build your business credit your EIN profile and score then becomes essential to helping you qualify for bank loans and credit cards. And you can use EIN credit and EIN credit alone to get approved for many types of credit without a personal guarantee. Every highly-successful privately and publicly owned company in the United States has business credit. But what many don't know is that even startups can also obtain it if you follow the right steps."

      "question": "What makes this system so different than other business credit building programs?",
      "answer": "This is the only system in the world which successfully combines both business credit building and funding. This means clients can build their business credit and get money right away. If they have good credit or collateral, they can secure money in less than 30 days. The suite is also the only system that shows business owners how to get free access to Experian Smart Business, and we help you get your D-U-N-S number with D&B, and list your phone number with 411 for free. This alone saves you thousands. The finance suite has more lending sources, revolving business credit accounts, and starter vendor accounts than any other system on the market today. And the finance suite is the only system with one-click access to business credibility sources, underwriting guidelines provided for all business credit sources, and by far is the most advanced business credit building technology available today."
